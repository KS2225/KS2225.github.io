abstractNote={ Generating music has a few notable differences from generating images and videos. First, music is an art of time, necessitating a temporal model. Second, music is usually composed of multiple instruments/tracks with their own temporal dynamics, but collectively they unfold over time interdependently. Lastly, musical notes are often grouped into chords, arpeggios or melodies in polyphonic music, and thereby introducing a chronological ordering of notes is not naturally suitable. In this paper, we propose three models for symbolic multi-track music generation under the framework of generative adversarial networks (GANs). The three models, which differ in the underlying assumptions and accordingly the network architectures, are referred to as the jamming model, the composer model and the hybrid model. We trained the proposed models on a dataset of over one hundred thousand bars of rock music and applied them to generate piano-rolls of five tracks: bass, drums, guitar, piano and strings. A few intra-track and inter-track objective metrics are also proposed to evaluate the generative results, in addition to a subjective user study. We show that our models can generate coherent music of four bars right from scratch (i.e. without human inputs). We also extend our models to human-AI cooperative music generation: given a specific track composed by human, we can generate four additional tracks to accompany it.

  abstract={We propose a generative model for music extension in this paper. The model is composed of two classifiers, one for music emotion and one for music tonality, and a generative adversarial network (GAN). Therefore, it can generate symbolic music not only based on low level spectral and temporal characteristics, but also on high level emotion and tonality attributes of previously observed music pieces. The generative model works in a universal latent space constructed by the variational autoencoder (VAE) for representing music pieces. We conduct subjective listening tests and derive objective measures for performance evaluation. Experimental results show that the proposed model produces much smoother and more authentic music pieces than the baseline model in terms of all subjective and objective measures.},

  abstract={Music accompaniment generation is a crucial aspect in the composition process. Deep neural networks have made significant strides in this field, but it remains a challenge for AI to effectively incorporate human emotions to create beautiful accompaniments. Existing models struggle to effectively characterize human emotions within neural network models while composing music. To address this issue, we propose the use of an easy-to-represent emotion flow model, the Valence/Arousal Curve, which allows for the compatibility of emotional information within the model through data transformation and enhances interpretability of emotional factors by utilizing a Variational Autoencoder as the model structure. Further, we used relative self-attention to maintain the structure of the music at music phrase level and to generate a richer accompaniment when combined with the rules of music theory. Our experimental results indicate that the emotional flow of the music generated by our model has a strong correlation with the input emotion, demonstrating the model's strong interpretability and control of emotional flow. The generated music is also well-structured, diverse, and dynamic, outperforming the baseline models.},
